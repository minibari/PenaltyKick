Wanted to do my first project to learn basics of JS OOP.

(I have already learned basics of HTML, CSS, JS and C# OOP using console apps)



The idea is to have a moving goalkeeper with the player aiming with his mouse and shooting with mouse click.

With each goal, the speed of the goalkeeper will increase. The speed of the shot will remain the same.
